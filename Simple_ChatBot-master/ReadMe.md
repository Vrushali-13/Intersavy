1. About task: The load_students_from_csv function is responsible for loading student data from the CSV file, similar to the previous example. We define two routes in the Flask app: the root route '/' renders the index.html template, and the /get_student_info route processes the form submission and retrieves the student information based on the input.
2. When you run the app.py file, Flask will start a local web server. You can access the chatbot in your browser
3. You'll see a form where you can enter a student's name. After submitting the form, the chatbot will display the student's information if found, or a "Student not found" message if no match is found.
